# 6. Evaluate the following numerical expressions in your head, then use the Python interpreter to check your results:
# (a) >>> 5 % 2 = 1
# (b) >>> 9 % 5 = 4
# (c) >>> 15 % 12 = 3
# (d) >>> 12 % 15 = 12
# (e) >>> 6 % 6 = 0
# (f) >>> 0 % 7 = 0
# (g) >>> 7 % 0 = 0
print(5%2, 9%5, 15%12, 12%15, 6%6, 0%7)
print(9%5)
print(15%12)
print(12%15)
print(6%6)
print(0%7)
# print(7%0) ERROR INTEGER DIVISION BY ZERO

# What happened with the last example? Why? If you were able to correctly anticipate the computerâ€™s response in all but the last one, it is time to move on.
#   If not, take time now to make up examples of your own. Explore the modulus operator until you are confident
#   you understand how it works.
